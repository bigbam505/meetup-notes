### Some take aways
* Soft skills are the hardest to master
* Setting goals
  * Good goals are measureable
  * Good goals are manageable
  * If you miss a goal reflect and adjust the goal
* Be able to measure progress
* Culture is people, Deal with problems; work with people
  * Try and offer some guidance together with people so you can help them and
  make them not feel like they aren't worth the time.
* It takes time (Becoming relevant takes time)
* Make people feel relevant

### Problems Faced
* Had system level metrics but did not have any application level metrics to
  correlate data to traffic spikes etc
* Very low communication between helpdesk / ops / developers
* Cant force people to communicate

### Solutions at some point
* Encourage responsibility, accountability and collaboration through operations
  transparency
  * Accountability: trust you to do your job
  * Collaboration: Talk to your peers about solutions and methods
* Come up with goals that you could reach and communicate the goals to people (team etc)
* Do your job as best you can so people associate your team with knowing their
  shit
* Give context to what you do as a team
* Lunch and learns
  * Monthly
  * Knowledge Sharing
  * Relaxed Atmosphere
* Added Dashboards, Ticket system, Wiki (Helpdesk howtos, design docs,
  Postmortem docs)
* Show new employees the wiki (Trick them to use it)
  * Make it into a game, everyone loves a game
* Blameless Postmortems
  * Invited everyone
  * Measure: Volume, duration, frequency
* Open-Air Displays  (Dada dada daddaa dada... or something like this)
  * Allow you to measure and report

### Results
* Got into peoples heads
* Silos began to erode
* Tool Adoption
  * Improved vastly
* Trust, Confidence, Relevance
